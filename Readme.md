# Coffeebox Inventory Management System
Coffeebox started as a learning project which has eventually transformed into a pet project. Coffeebox tracks inventory of the quantity of coffee, and how they are sold and distributed. The application is written in C# and built on the .NET Core framework. The database uses PostgreSQL, and the future frontend of the development project will be in React JS.
